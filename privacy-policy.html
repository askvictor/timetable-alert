<h1>Timetable Notifier Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    Timetable Notifier is an extension for Chrome and other compatible browsers. It uses your Google login in order to
    access the Google Sheet or Google Calendar containing the timetable needed to provide alerts.
    In order to interact with the spreadsheet or calendar, it requires your authorisation.
    The extension collects the relevant information (i.e. the timetable structure and terms dates from a spreadsheet, or
    the next 24 hours worth of events from the calendar you have specified) from the spreadsheet or calendar, and
    stores it in your browser's storage area, which may be synchronised across multiple browser instances using Google's
    sync mechanisms (this may involve some relevant data being stored on Google's servers). No data (about you, from
    your spreadsheets or from your calendars) are collected or stored on any PositiveState.net servers, and any data
    read from your spreadsheets or calendars is done solely for the purposes of fulfilling the extension's functionality.
